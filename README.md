## Specifications of keys and modifiers


  ### Modifiers
  There are only four different modifier keys, *control, shift, alt and meta (windows/command depending on your OS)*. 
  
  These modifiers can be added to the typical keys to produce things like upper case letters and special characters *like !@#$":{}()*.
 
  The accepted modifiers are: *control, shift, alt, windows, command*. There is no *fn* modifier

  ### Keys
  A key is simple a lower case letter or number such as, *a-z* and *0-9*, only keys can be entered when creating a new instance in the key editor.

  If you enter a letter as upper case, *A-Z*, in the key configurator, it will be printed out as lower case. To fix this you must add a modifier to the key instance. i.e. Entering 'A' will print 'a', by addeding 'shift' it will print 'A'
  
  Keys such as *tab, delete, backspace, f1-f19, (up, down, left and right_arrow)* will work fine.
  
  Media keys such as *play/pause, skip track* will not work.
